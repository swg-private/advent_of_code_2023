# Advent of Code 2023

All solutions given are implemented in Perl. To date the following tasks have been successfully
completed given the input in the respective `input.txt` files that can be found in the respective
folders for the day:

- Day 1: Tasks 1 and 2
- Day 2: Tasks 1 and 2
- Day 3: Tasks 1 and 2
- Day 4: Tasks 1 and 2
- Day 5: Task 1
- Day 6: Tasks 1 and 2
- Day 7: Task 1
- Day 8: Task 1
- Day 9: Task 1
- Day 10: Task 1

All solutions work without a newer Perl version (and the version pragmas enabled), but have been
developed on Perl v5.30.3 on OSX. The code for the respective days can be run as such:

```shell
$ cd day_XX/
$ perl ./<script_name>.pl
```

By convention the script will output either one or two sentences respectively, with the answer to
the solved tasks in sequence. The code is neither designed to be maintainable, nor to be extendable.
The main focus is to get all code squeezed into one file, core modules (i.e. non-CPAN) modules are
used where appropriate.
